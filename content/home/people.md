The current composition of my research group:

- **Eleni-Rosalina Andrinopoulou**: Elrozy is post-Doc working on several extensions of joint models. Currently on time-varying association structures, and a combination of shared random effects joint models with joint latent class models. More info on her GitHub page.

- **Sara Baart**: Sara is a PhD student working on fitting joint models in studies with special types of designs, and in particular in case-cohort designs.

- **Nicole Erler**: Nicole is a PhD student working on methods for analyzing longitudinal outcomes with missing baseline and time-varying covariates. She currently also writes an R package for implementing a full Bayesian anlysis in such settings under the sequential approach. More info on her GitHub page.

- **Floor van Oudenhoven**: Floor is a PhD student working in novel applications and methodology of joint models in clinical trials. Her motivation comes from Alzheimer's disease.

- **Grigorios Papageorgiou**: Greg is a PhD student working on adapting joint models to incorporate time-varying interventions during follow-up and assess their performance.  

- **Anirudh Tomer**: Anirudh is a PhD student working in developing new methods for personalized screening and active surveilance. He works closely with the [PRIAS project](https://www.prias-project.org/).
